# Project Instructions

> **IMPORTANT**: This project uses `AGENT.md` for agent instructions.

## Instructions for Claude Code

**You MUST read `AGENT.md` before doing anything else.**

The `AGENT.md` file contains all project-specific instructions, workflows, and guidelines. Read it first to keep the full context in memory for this session.

All project instructions, tech stack details, architecture notes, and workflow guidelines are in:
- **`AGENT.md`** - Main project instructions (read this first)
- **`AgentUsage/`** - Detailed workflow guides and best practices
- Special Reminder from the user:
> This site is my authentic voice—warm, introspective, queer, unapologetically building something meaningful; write like you're helping me speak, not perform.
- Reminder from the User for when we Work:
> Write with the warmth of a midnight tea shop and the clarity of good documentation—this is my space, make it feel like home.

*This structure aligns with industry-standard agentic coding practices.*
