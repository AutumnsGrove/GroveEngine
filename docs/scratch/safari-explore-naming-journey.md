# Naming Journey: Safari Explore

## What Is This Thing?

**Fundamentally:**

- Not an animal. Not a gathering. An _expedition_.
- A new category in the Grove skill ecosystem.
- The immersive, roleplay-driven wrapper for "systematically review and polish a collection of related items."

**What does it DO?**

- Turns tedious audit/review/polish work into an adventure
- Drives through N related items (curios, pages, components, API endpoints — whatever)
- At each stop: observe what exists, document findings, design improvements
- Produces a comprehensive expedition journal (the plan document)

**What emotion should it evoke?**

- Fun. Adventure. Discovery. The thrill of seeing something new through binoculars.
- The satisfying crunch of a jeep on savanna dirt.
- Sunset camp with a journal full of sketches and notes.

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove. I see the animals already here...

Bloodhound tracking scents through the underbrush — but it scouts _code_, not collections.
Vulture circling the issue board — but it _cleans up_ dead issues, not _designs polish plans_.
Eagle soaring above for architecture — but it sees _systems_, not _item-by-item inventories_.
Panther stalking a single bug — surgical, one target, not a whole landscape.

None of them do what the user needs: _driving through a collection, stopping at each one, observing, documenting, designing._

I need something that feels like an expedition. A journey with many stops. Where the FUN is the journey itself.

I walk past the animals. Past the gatherings. I leave the forest entirely.

I'm in Africa now. Red dirt. Acacia trees. The golden light of late afternoon. A jeep rumbles beneath me. Binoculars hang from my neck. A leather journal is open on my lap.

This isn't a creature. It's an _experience_.

## Candidates

**Safari** 🚙

- Natural meaning: A journey to observe wildlife in their natural habitat
- Why it fits: PERFECTLY. You're observing code/components "in the wild." Each item is a creature you stop to study. You document what you see. You don't intervene during the safari — you observe, sketch, plan. The intervention comes later.
- The vibe: Adventure, discovery, immersion, fun
- Potential issues: Not nature-forest themed? But that's the POINT — it's a departure from the Grove animal system. It's something different.

**Expedition** 🧭

- Natural meaning: A journey undertaken for a specific purpose
- Why it fits: Academic, thorough, purpose-driven
- The vibe: More serious, less playful
- Potential issues: Too formal. The user wants FUN.

**Trek** 🥾

- Natural meaning: A long arduous journey
- Why it fits: Covers ground, multiple stops
- The vibe: Exhausting? Not quite right.
- Potential issues: Sounds like work, not adventure.

## The Tagline Test

"Safari is where you drive through a collection and observe everything in the wild."
"Safari is the adventure that makes polish planning feel like discovery."

## Selection: Safari Explore 🚙

The user named this one. And it's perfect. Safari captures:

- Multiple stops (not one target)
- Observation before intervention
- The joy of discovery
- Something fundamentally different from the animal skills

**New ecosystem category: Expedition**

- Animals do ONE focused task
- Gatherings orchestrate MULTIPLE animals
- Expeditions EXPLORE a collection of things and produce a plan

The safari is the first expedition. There may be others someday.
