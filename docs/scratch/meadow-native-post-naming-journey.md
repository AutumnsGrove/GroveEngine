# Meadow Native Post — Naming Journey

## What Are We Naming?

Short-form posts written directly on Meadow. 500 characters max. The Twitter-like
quick thoughts that live alongside syndicated Blooms in the community feed.

The duality:

- **Blooms** grow in your garden, drift to the meadow via RSS
- **[???]** grow natively in the meadow itself

## What IS This Thing?

Fundamentally: a short, spontaneous expression. You open Meadow, type a thought,
and it appears in the feed. No blog post. No title required. No featured image.
Just words in the clearing.

It's NOT:

- A blog post (that's a Bloom)
- A comment (that's Reeds)
- A DM (doesn't exist yet)
- An article or essay

It IS:

- Quick
- Spontaneous
- Social
- Native to the meadow (doesn't come from anywhere else)
- Short (500 chars)
- Personal expression without the weight of "publishing"

## The Metaphor Space

What happens in a meadow?

```
                    ☀️
              🦋         🐝
         🌼      🌾  🌾      🌻
      🌿    🌸        🌺    🌿
   ──────────────────────────────────
   grass sways    wildflowers bloom
   seeds drift    crickets sing
   dew glistens   fireflies glow
   clover grows   dandelion puffs scatter
```

### The Key Distinction

Blooms are CULTIVATED. You tend them in your garden. You write, edit, polish,
publish. They're substantial. They have titles and featured images and tags.
Then they drift to the meadow via the poller.

This new thing is WILD. It pops up right there in the meadow. No cultivation.
No garden. Just... expression, growing where it stands.

## Candidates

### 1. Sprout

- Small, new, quick growth popping up from soil
- "I posted a sprout" — feels natural
- But sprouts become something bigger. A sprout implies a precursor,
  not the final thing. These posts ARE the thing.

### 2. Wildflower

- Beautiful contrast: Blooms are cultivated, Wildflowers are wild
- Grows right in the meadow, no garden needed
- "I posted a wildflower" — lovely but LONG
- Two syllables vs one would be better for UI
- Could abbreviate? No. Don't force it.

### 3. Clover

- Small, common, grows natively in meadows
- Lucky to find (four-leaf clover)
- "I posted a clover" — cute but maybe too cute?
- Doesn't capture the expression/voice aspect

### 4. Murmur

- A quiet voice in the meadow
- "I shared a murmur" — poetic, fits the intimacy
- But murmur implies barely audible. These are public.

### 5. Wisp

- TAKEN (Writing Assistant). Dead end.

### 6. Petal

- TAKEN (Content Safety). Dead end.

### 7. Mote

- A tiny particle floating in sunlight
- "I shared a mote" — ethereal but maybe too abstract
- People might not know what a mote is

### 8. Drift

- Seeds drift through meadows on the wind
- "I posted a drift" — movement, lightness, ephemeral feeling
- But "drift" might confuse with Blooms drifting IN from groves
- Also feels passive. Posting is active.

### 9. Sprig

- A small shoot or stem with leaves
- "I posted a sprig" — fresh, green, small
- Quick to say. Nature-forward. Meadow-native.
- A sprig is complete in itself (unlike a sprout)
- You pick a sprig of herbs. It's small but whole.

### 10. Seedling

- TAKEN (subscription tier). Dead end.

### 11. Tuft

- A small bunch of grass or flowers growing together
- "I posted a tuft" — earthy but awkward to say

### 12. Tendril

- A reaching, curling growth
- "I shared a tendril" — beautiful metaphor for a thought reaching out
- But tendrils are part of vines (and Vines is already a thing in Lattice)

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. I walk past my garden where my Blooms grow tall and colorful.
I step through the treeline into the Meadow. It's open. Sunny. Others are here.

I see their Blooms that drifted in from their gardens — substantial, full posts
with titles and images.

But I also see... something else. Smaller things. Quick thoughts someone planted
right here in the meadow. Not transplanted from a garden. Native.

What do they look like?

Not flowers exactly. Flowers are Blooms. These are...

...actually, what grows wild in a meadow that ISN'T a flower?

Grass. Moss. Clover. Ferns.

But also: WILDFLOWERS. The distinction isn't flower vs not-flower.
It's cultivated vs wild.

Wait. Let me reconsider "Wildflower."

The word IS long. But what if we just used... **Wild**?

"I posted a wild."
"Check out my latest wilds."
"The meadow has 3 new wilds today."

Hmm. Doesn't quite land as a noun.

What about... the actual act of what happens in a meadow?

You don't plant in a meadow. You don't cultivate.
Things SCATTER. Seeds scatter. Dandelion puffs scatter.

**Scatter?** "I scattered a thought" — too verb-y as a noun.

Back to the feeling. What does it feel like to post a quick thought?

It's like... tossing a pebble into a stream. Or...
blowing a dandelion and watching the seeds float away.

**Dandelion.** Hmm. Long word again. But there's something in "puff" —
a dandelion puff. Light, floating, ephemeral-looking but the seeds ARE
the future. They drift, they land, they take root.

**Puff.** "I posted a puff." Too trivial.

Let me go back to what RESONATED most:

1. **Sprig** — small, whole, fresh, quick to say
2. **Wildflower** — perfect metaphor, imperfect length
3. **Sprout** — implies becoming something else

Actually... I keep coming back to something.

In a meadow, when grass is short and the sun is warm, you see small things
growing close to the ground. Violets. Tiny white flowers. Things you'd miss
if you weren't looking.

What are those called in a forest/meadow context?

**Undergrowth.** No, that's forest floor.

**Groundcover.** Functional, not poetic.

Okay. New angle entirely.

What do BIRDS do in a meadow? They sing. Short songs.

But we don't want animal metaphors. We want plant/nature metaphors.

What do BEES do? They visit flowers. No.

What about the SOUND of a meadow?

Rustling. Humming. Buzzing.

**Rustle.** "I posted a rustle." Something stirring in the grass.
Brief. Organic. You hear it and you look.

Actually... hm. Not quite.

Let me try the tagline test with my top candidates:

"**Sprigs** are where you share a quick thought in the meadow."
→ "A sprig of thought." Works.

"**Wilds** are where you share a quick thought in the meadow."
→ Confusing.

"**Rustles** are where you share a quick thought in the meadow."
→ "Leave a rustle." Interesting but forced.

Coming back to SPRIG.

### Why Sprig Might Be The One

A sprig is:

- Small — a short stem with leaves, complete in itself
- Fresh — just picked, just growing, alive
- Quick — you pluck a sprig in a second
- Nature-native — grows in meadows, gardens, forests, everywhere
- NOT a flower — it's distinct from a Bloom
- Whole — unlike a sprout (precursor) or seed (potential), a sprig IS the thing
- Beautiful — sprigs of lavender, sprigs of mint, sprigs of rosemary

"Post a sprig." Quick.
"Read Alice's latest sprig." Natural.
"The meadow has 12 new sprigs today." Works.
"Sprigs and Blooms." The dual timeline.

The tagline: "A small thought, freshly picked."

Or: "Plant a sprig in the meadow."

The metaphor chain:

> You **bloom** in your garden (long-form writing)
> You plant **sprigs** in the meadow (quick thoughts)
> Both appear in the feed, growing together

### The Sprig Entry

**Sprig** — A quick thought planted in the Meadow.

A sprig is a small stem with a few leaves — whole, fresh, plucked in a moment.
Not a full bloom. Not trying to be. Just a living thing, growing where it lands.

Sprigs are short posts (500 characters) written directly on Meadow. No title
needed. No featured image. Just your words, planted in the clearing for others
to find. Where Blooms are cultivated in your garden and drift to the meadow,
Sprigs grow right here — native, spontaneous, wild.

_A small thought, freshly picked._

## Round 2: The Birds in the Canopy

Sprig was too cutesy. The user pointed to something important: Twitter's "tweet"
worked because it was related to a bird. Short communication IS birdsong.
Brief, musical, carries across the clearing.

The grove has birds. They live in the canopy. They sing in the meadow.
What sounds do they make?

### The Bird Sound Candidates

**Song** — "I posted a song." Beautiful, but songs are long. These are short.
Also conflicts with Aria (music curation).

**Call** — "I posted a call." A bird call is short, purposeful. But "call"
has too many other meanings (phone call, function call, call to action).

**Chirp** — "I posted a chirp." Quick, bright, small. But... this was
literally Twitter's original verb before "tweet." Feels derivative.

**Trill** — "I posted a trill." A rapid alternation of notes. Musical,
quick, distinctive. Each bird's trill is unique.
"Read Alice's latest trill." Hmm. Musical but maybe too niche a word.

**Warble** — "I posted a warble." Melodic, varied. But warble also means
unsteady/wavering. Mixed signal.

**Peep** — "I posted a peep." Short, small sound. But "peep" has too many
other connotations (peeping, marshmallow peeps).

**Note** — "I posted a note." A single musical note. Short, clear, deliberate.
Every bird contributes a note to the meadow's chorus.
"Read Alice's latest note." Natural.
"The meadow has 12 new notes today." Works.
BUT — "note" is extremely generic. Notes on a phone. Sticky notes. Music notes.
It doesn't feel special enough for Grove.

**Lark** — "I posted a lark." A lark is a meadow bird that sings while flying.
Skylarks are literally THE meadow bird. They sing ascending into open sky.
Also: "on a lark" means doing something spontaneous, for fun.
"Post a lark." Spontaneous expression. A meadow bird singing.
"Read Alice's larks." Her quick thoughts.
"Larks and Blooms." The dual timeline.

**Robin** — Nah, too specific/proper-name-feeling.

**Wren** — "I posted a wren." Wrens are tiny birds with loud songs.
Small but mighty. But naming posts after a specific bird feels odd.

**Flutter** — "I posted a flutter." Movement of wings. Quick, light.
"Read the latest flutters." Hmm. Not bad but feels like motion, not voice.

**Quill** — "I posted a quill." Bird feather + writing tool.
"Drop a quill in the meadow." Interesting double meaning.
But quill implies longer writing (quill and parchment).

### Wait. Going deeper on LARK.

A skylark (Alauda arvensis) is THE meadow bird. They're famous for:

- Singing while ascending vertically into open sky
- Living in meadows and open grassland (not forests)
- Continuous, joyful song
- Being symbols of joy and spontaneity in poetry

Shakespeare, Shelley, Wordsworth all wrote about larks.
"Hail to thee, blithe Spirit! / Bird thou never wert" — Shelley

And "on a lark" = doing something spontaneous, playful, just because.

**The double meaning is perfect:**

1. A meadow bird that sings ascending into open sky
2. Something done spontaneously, for the joy of it

"Post a lark." = Share a spontaneous thought.
"Alice's latest lark." = Her quick expression.
"Larks and Blooms in the meadow." = Short thoughts and long posts, together.

The tagline test:

> "Larks are where you share a quick thought in the meadow."
> → "A lark is a spontaneous song, rising from the meadow."

Vs. other bird sounds:

> "Post a trill." — Too musical/niche.
> "Post a chirp." — Too Twitter-derivative.
> "Post a note." — Too generic.
> "Post a lark." — Spontaneous. Joyful. A meadow bird. YES.

### The Lark Entry

**Lark** — A spontaneous thought, rising from the Meadow.

A lark is a small bird that lives in open meadows and sings while climbing
into the sky. No perch needed. No branch. Just voice and air and joy. To do
something "on a lark" is to do it spontaneously, for the fun of it.

Larks are short posts (500 characters) shared directly on Meadow. No title.
No featured image. Just your voice, rising from the clearing. Where Blooms
are cultivated in your garden and drift to the meadow, Larks are born here.
Quick, joyful, ascending.

_A song that needs no branch._

## Round 3: The Sound, Not the Bird

Lark was close but wrong axis. "Tweet" worked because it's the SOUND
a bird makes, not the bird. The action of expression, not the creature.

What sounds do birds make?

**Tweet** — taken (obviously)
**Chirp** — derivative of Twitter
**Trill** — rapid alternating notes. Musical, quick, distinctive.
**Warble** — melodic but wavering
**Coo** — too soft, pigeon energy
**Crow** — too harsh
**Whistle** — "I posted a whistle." Hmm. Piercing, attention-getting.
But whistling is usually one note, not a message.
**Hum** — TAKEN (music link previews)
**Peep** — too many other meanings
**Pip** — a short, high sound. Baby birds pip when hatching.
"I posted a pip." Short. Quick. But pip has tech connotations (Python).
**Twig-snap** — not a bird sound but lol

Okay. Broader: what are the short, natural sounds of a meadow?

**Rustle** — grass, wind, movement. "I posted a rustle."
Something stirring. Brief. But passive.
**Hush** — quiet settling. The opposite of expression.
**Buzz** — insects, energy. "I posted a buzz." But buzzy = anxiety.
**Cricket** — nighttime meadow sound. But it's a bug name.
**Snap** — twig breaking. Too sharp.

Hmm. Let me think about what BIRDSONG actually IS in nature.

Birdsong serves two purposes:

1. Territory — "I'm here, this is mine"
2. Connection — "Where are you? I'm here."

Short bird calls specifically are about PRESENCE. Announcing yourself.
Saying "I exist, right now, in this spot."

That's exactly what a short meadow post is. Announcing your presence
in the clearing. Saying "I'm here. This is what I'm thinking."

What words capture that?

**Call** — "I posted a call." A bird call is short, distinctive,
says "I'm here." But call has too many meanings.

**Cry** — Too dramatic.

**Song** — Too long-form.

Wait. What about words that describe TYPES of short bird vocalizations?

In ornithology:

- **Song** = long, complex vocalization
- **Call** = short, simple vocalization
- **Note** = a single unit of sound
- **Phrase** = a repeated pattern of notes

A "note" is the atomic unit of birdsong. One clear sound.
"I posted a note." — Simple. Clear. Universal.

But we rejected this earlier for being too generic...

Unless we reframe it.

In music, a note is the smallest complete expression.
In writing, a note is a brief message.
In birdsong, a note is a single clear sound.

"Post a note in the meadow."
"Alice left a note."
"3 new notes in the meadow today."

Generic? Or universal?

The problem with "note" is it's used EVERYWHERE. Sticky notes.
Apple Notes. Musical notes. Thank-you notes.

It doesn't feel SPECIAL enough for Grove...

...

What about **Trill**?

A trill is a rapid alternation between two notes. In music, it's a
ornamental flourish. In birdsong, it's a distinctive short call —
each species has its own trill, like a fingerprint.

"Post a trill." — Musical, quick, distinctive.
"Alice's latest trill." — Her unique voice.
"Trills and Blooms in the meadow." — Songs and flowers. Beautiful.

A trill is:

- Short by definition (a quick succession of notes)
- Distinctive (every bird's trill is unique)
- Musical (it's joyful, not mechanical)
- A real word people know (piano trills, bird trills, phone trills)
- NOT taken in the Grove ecosystem

"Trill" as a verb: "She trilled a thought into the meadow."

The tagline: "A quick song, unmistakably yours."

Or: "Every voice has its own trill."

Hmm. Let me also consider one more...

**Whisper** — we considered this in round 1 but it was dismissed as
"too quiet / these are public." But wait. Meadow IS intimate. It's
not a megaphone. It's a group of friends in a clearing. You don't
shout. You share. Whispering in a meadow IS how you communicate
when you're close enough to be heard.

"Post a whisper." — Intimate, personal, quick.
"Alice's whispers." — Her quiet thoughts.
"Whispers and Blooms." — Soft words and full flowers.

But... whisper implies secrecy. These aren't secret. They're just small.

Okay, I think my top two are:

1. **Trill** — musical, distinctive, short bird sound
2. **Note** — universal, simple, the atomic unit of expression

Let me do the final tagline test:

**Trill:**

> "Trills are quick thoughts shared in the Meadow. Your voice, your rhythm."
> _Every voice has its own trill._

**Note:**

> "Notes are quick thoughts left in the Meadow. Simple, clear, yours."
> _Leave a note in the clearing._

---

## FINAL: Note

The walk ended here. Note won because it's universal without being empty.
Three resonances in one word:

1. **Birdsong** — the atomic unit of a bird's call
2. **Music** — a single, clear expression
3. **Writing** — a brief message left for someone to find
