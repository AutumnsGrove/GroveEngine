# Voice Transcription Naming Journey

> *Finding the name for Grove's voice-to-text feature*

Started: January 25, 2026

---

## The Problem

We need a name for voice transcription in Grove. Wanderers speak into their device, and their words become text in Flow mode (the markdown editor).

**What it's NOT:**
- "Echo" — rejected. Echoes are hollow repetitions. Also "echo chamber" vibes.
- "Murmur" — too delicate, too wispy. Needs more substance.

**Technical reality:**
- Browser records audio via MediaRecorder API
- Audio sent to Lumen (AI gateway)
- Lumen routes to Cloudflare Workers AI Whisper
- Transcribed text returned and inserted at cursor

But the name isn't about the tech. It's about the experience.

## Visualizing the Grove

```

                    🌲    🌳    🌲    🌲
                 🌲    🌲    🌳    🌲
              🌲    🌳    🌲    🌲    🌳

```

**Where things live:**
- **Meadow** — the open social space (center clearing)
- **Heartwood** — core identity (deep in the tree)
- **Arbor** — where you tend your tree (admin)
- **Flow mode** — where you write (inside Arbor)
- **Lumen** — the hollow through which AI flows (underground)
- **Wisp** — writing assistant (a light that guides)
- **Fireside** — conversation mode of Wisp (warmth, talking)

Voice transcription lives... where?

It's part of Flow mode. It's how you input text without typing.
It's related to Wisp (writing help) but it's not AI generation.
It passes through Lumen but isn't Lumen itself.

---

## What IS This Thing?

### Fundamentally:
- It's **capturing spoken words** and making them permanent
- It's **transformation** — ephemeral voice becomes lasting text
- It's **flow** — thoughts moving from mind → voice → page
- It's **listening** — the grove hears you and remembers

### What it does for a Wanderer:
- Removes typing friction
- Captures thoughts before they escape
- Enables writing while mobile, walking, lying down
- Accessibility for those who can't type easily
- Makes the blank page less intimidating

### The emotion it should evoke:
- **Natural** — like talking to yourself while walking
- **Substantial** — your words matter, they're being captured
- **Grounded** — not floaty or ethereal
- **Warm** — the grove is listening, not a machine

---

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove at dusk. The day's thoughts are still buzzing.

I walk past the Meadow where others are gathered, sharing.
I find my tree — my blog, my space.
I climb into Arbor, open Flow mode.

The blank page waits.

I don't want to type. My hands are tired. Or I'm on my phone.
Or the words just... they come out better when I talk.

I look around Flow mode. What do I reach for?

There's Wisp — but Wisp helps me edit, refine, polish.
There's Fireside — but Fireside is a conversation, back-and-forth.

This is different. I just want to **speak** and have the grove **remember**.

What do I see? What's the tool?

---

## Rejected Directions

### Too Delicate / Ethereal
- **Murmur** — too soft, wispy, insubstantial
- **Whisper** — also the model name (Whisper AI), confusing
- **Breath** — too abstract, too biological
- **Mist** — evaporates, doesn't feel permanent
- **Zephyr** — too fancy, too Greek

### Too Technical / Cold
- **Transcribe** — clinical
- **Dictate** — corporate, secretary vibes
- **Record** — generic, no soul

### Already Taken or Conflicting
- **Echo** — "echo chamber" negative, also just repetition
- **Breeze** — already Breeze mode in Terrarium
- **Clearing** — already the status page

### Wrong Vibe
- **Lark** — too playful, "larking about"
- **Chatter** — negative connotation, trivial
- **Chirp** — too small, too cute
- **Warble** — unsteady, uncertain

---

## Exploring New Directions

### Theme: Things That LISTEN in Nature

The grove listens. What in nature listens?

- **Owls** — silent hunters, all-hearing... but predatory
- **Rabbits** — ears always twitching... but prey animals
- **The forest floor** — absorbs all sound
- **A still pond** — receives everything, reflects

What about things that **receive** sound and **hold** it?

### Theme: Transformation (Voice → Text)

What in nature transforms one thing into another?

- **Amber** — already taken (storage), but: resin becomes stone
- **Chrysalis** — caterpillar becomes butterfly
- **Frost** — water vapor becomes visible pattern
- **Dew** — invisible moisture becomes visible drops
- **Sap** — flows, carries nutrients, becomes something else

### Theme: Sound Becoming Permanent

- **Groove** — literally what records hold sound (vinyl grooves)
- **Carve** — sound carved into wax, into wood
- **Etch** — already taken (link saving)
- **Press** — already taken (image processing)
- **Score** — marking, recording... also music

### Theme: Natural Sound That Has Substance

Not whispers. Not murmurs. What sounds in nature have WEIGHT?

- **Thunder** — too aggressive
- **Roar** — too loud
- **Call** — bird calls, animal calls... purposeful sound
- **Cry** — too sad
- **Song** — has substance... "Songbird" is the injection protection though
- **Tone** — too clinical
- **Hum** — steady, continuous, grounded... interesting

### Theme: Receiving and Keeping

- **Vessel** — receives and holds
- **Basin** — catches water, holds it
- **Well** — deep, receives, stores
- **Catch** — catching words like catching rain

---

## Candidates Round 2

### 1. **Hum**
A hum is steady, grounded, continuous. Not delicate — it has resonance. You can hum while you work. Bees hum. Machines hum. It's substantial.

> "Hum your thoughts into existence."

But... "hum" might be too mechanical? Power lines hum. Refrigerators hum.

### 2. **Call**
A call is purposeful sound. Bird calls. A call across the valley. You're calling out your thoughts and they're being received.

> "Call your words into the grove."

But... might feel too loud, too urgent.

### 3. **Grove** (verb)
Wait — can we verb the name itself? "Grove your thoughts"? No, that's confusing.

### 4. **Canopy**
The canopy receives all the sound of the forest. It's overhead, encompassing.

> "Speak to the canopy. Watch your words descend."

Interesting but maybe too abstract.

### 5. **Catch**
You catch your thoughts before they escape. Simple, active verb.

> "Catch your thoughts before they fly."

But "catch" isn't very nature-specific. Could be anything.

### 6. **Root** (verb)
Your spoken words take root, become permanent.

> "Root your voice in the page."

Hmm. "Root" as verb is nice but might confuse with "Rooted" (subscriber identity).

### 7. **Settle**
Like sediment settling. Your words settle onto the page.

> "Let your thoughts settle."

Maybe too passive?

### 8. **Perch**
Where a bird lands to sing. A vantage point. Your words perch on the page.

> "Find your perch. Speak."

But "perch" is also a fish. And it's where you ARE, not what you DO.

### 9. **Alight**
Birds alight on branches. Your words alight on the page.

> "Speak, and watch your words alight."

Beautiful but maybe too delicate still?

### 10. **Roost**
Where birds come home to rest. Your words find their roost.

> "Your voice finds its roost."

Hmm. Roost has connotations of sleeping, ending the day.

---

## Going Deeper: What's the Core Action?

Strip away the poetry. What is the Wanderer DOING?

1. **Speaking** — primary action
2. **Being heard** — the grove receives their voice
3. **Words appearing** — transformation happens
4. **Text remains** — permanence

The magic moment is: **the grove hears you and writes it down.**

What in nature does this? What HEARS and RECORDS?

- **Rings** — trees record their history in rings... but Rings is taken (analytics)
- **Bark** — trees wear their history... but bark doesn't listen
- **Stone** — receives carvings, holds them... but stone doesn't listen

What if the metaphor is about WHERE you speak, not what happens after?

---

## Theme: Places Where Speaking Feels Natural

In the grove, where do you go to speak and be heard?

- **A clearing** — taken
- **A hollow** — resonant, transforms sound
- **A glade** — open, quiet, sound carries
- **A dell** — small valley, intimate
- **A bower** — shaded shelter, private
- **A cove** — sheltered inlet... more water than forest
- **A nook** — taken (video sharing)
- **A den** — animal home, cozy... but too hidden?

### Hollow (Revisited)

A hollow tree trunk. You speak into it. Your voice resonates and becomes something else.

Connects to Lumen — "the hollow center of a tube."

> "Speak into the Hollow."

But "hollow" has negative connotations — empty, meaningless.

### Glen

A glen is a narrow valley. Scottish/Irish origin. Intimate, enclosed by hills.

> "In the Glen, your voice carries."

Nice but maybe too place-oriented? And not everyone knows "glen."

### Vale

A vale is a valley, often with a stream. Poetic.

> "Speak to the Vale."

Too archaic?

### Copse

A small group of trees. Intimate gathering.

> "In the Copse, speak freely."

Most people don't know "copse."

---

## Theme: The Act of Voice Becoming Permanent

What if the name is about the transformation itself?

- **Imprint** — your voice leaves an imprint
- **Trace** — your voice leaves a trace (but Trace is part of Weave)
- **Mark** — simple, direct
- **Cast** — casting your voice, like casting a spell

### Cast

You cast your voice into the grove. Casting also relates to:
- Casting a fishing line
- Casting a spell
- Casting shadows
- Cast of characters

> "Cast your voice. Watch it land."

This has substance! Not delicate. Active verb.

### Imprint

Your voice leaves an imprint on the page.

> "Imprint your voice."

Also substantial. But maybe too clinical?

---

## Theme: Natural Sound with Weight

What sounds in nature are SUBSTANTIAL, not wispy?

- **Thrum** — the deep vibration of a hive, of wings
- **Drone** — steady, deep sound... but negative connotations
- **Toll** — bells toll... too heavy, funereal
- **Peal** — bells peal... celebratory but not forest
- **Ring** — taken
- **Chime** — too delicate

### Thrum

A thrum is a low, continuous vibration. Hummingbird wings thrum. A beehive thrums. Guitar strings thrum.

> "Thrum your thoughts into being."

This has WEIGHT. It's not delicate. It's resonant and alive.

### Drone

A drone is a continuous low sound. But "drone" now means flying robots, and also boring speech.

Probably not.

---

## Candidates Round 3 (Substantial Ones)

| Name | Meaning | Vibe | Concern |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| **Cast** | Throw your voice out | Active, magical, substantial | Maybe too aggressive? |
| **Thrum** | Deep continuous vibration | Resonant, alive, grounded | Uncommon word |
| **Catch** | Capture thoughts | Simple, active | Not nature-specific |
| **Settle** | Words settle on page | Grounded, calm | Too passive? |
| **Alight** | Words land gently | Beautiful, precise | Still a bit delicate? |
| **Glen** | Intimate valley | Place-oriented, Scottish | Not everyone knows it |
| **Imprint** | Leave a mark | Permanent, substantial | Maybe too clinical |

---

## Testing Taglines

**Cast**
> "Cast your voice into the grove."
> "Cast is where speaking becomes writing."
> "Cast your thoughts. Watch them land."

**Thrum**
> "Thrum your thoughts into being."
> "The grove thrums with voices becoming words."
> "Thrum is the vibration of voice becoming text."

**Catch**
> "Catch your thoughts before they fly."
> "Catch is where the grove catches your voice."

**Settle**
> "Let your words settle."
> "Settle is where spoken thoughts find their place."

**Alight**
> "Speak, and watch your words alight."
> "Alight is where voice lands on the page."

---

## New Direction: The Listener

What if the feature is named after WHAT LISTENS, not what you do?

In the grove, what listens?

- **The Owl** — hears everything, sees in darkness
- **The Earth** — receives all sound
- **The Bark** — witness to everything
- **The Moss** — soft, absorbs, remembers

### Moss

Moss is soft but substantial. It covers everything. It absorbs sound. It's been here longer than the trees. Moss remembers.

> "Speak to the Moss."
> "Moss is where the grove listens."
> "The Moss hears. The Moss remembers."

I like this. Moss is:
- Soft but NOT delicate — it survives everything
- Ancient — older than trees
- Absorbent — takes in sound, moisture, everything
- Quiet but present — it's always there
- Grounded — literally on the ground, on bark, on stone

---

## Testing "Moss"

**As a feature name:**
> "Use Moss to speak your post into existence."
> "Enable Moss in Flow mode."
> "Moss: voice to text for the grove."

**Taglines:**
> "Speak to the Moss. It remembers."
> "Moss is where the grove listens."
> "The softest things remember longest."

**The entry:**
```
### Moss
**Voice Transcription** · *Integrated into Flow mode*

Moss is soft but it survives everything. It covers forest floors,
climbs tree bark, cushions stones. It absorbs sound, absorbs
moisture, absorbs time itself. Moss has been listening since
before the oldest tree took root.

Moss is voice transcription for Grove. Speak your thoughts and
watch them appear on the page. No typing. No friction. The Moss
hears you. The Moss remembers. Integrated through Lumen, running
at the edge — nothing to download, nothing to install.

*The softest things remember longest.*
```

---

## Alternative: Loam?

Wait — Loam is taken (name protection). Never mind.

---

## Alternative: Peat?

Peat is compressed moss, organic matter built up over centuries. It preserves things perfectly — bog bodies, ancient seeds. Peat remembers for millennia.

> "Speak to the Peat. It preserves."

But "peat" might be too obscure? And peat bogs are kind of... wet and dark.

---

## Alternative: Lichen?

Lichen is ancient, symbiotic, survives anywhere. But lichen doesn't really "listen."

---

## Alternative: Fern?

Ferns unfurl. Your words unfurl on the page. But ferns don't listen either.

---

## Coming Back to Verbs

Maybe the name should be a VERB, something you DO.

**What do you do when you speak to the grove?**

- You **speak** — too generic
- You **tell** — too generic
- You **voice** — interesting as verb? "Voice your thoughts"
- You **utter** — too formal
- You **say** — too generic
- You **pour** — you pour out your thoughts...

### Pour

You pour your thoughts out. They flow onto the page. Like pouring water, pouring yourself into something.

> "Pour your thoughts onto the page."
> "Pour is where voice becomes text."

"Pour" is active, substantial, natural (water pours), and emotional (pouring your heart out).

But... it's not particularly forest-themed.

### Spill

Similar to pour but more accidental. Probably not.

---

## What About "Speak"?

The simplest option. Just call it **Speak**.

> "Use Speak in Flow mode."
> "Speak your post into existence."

It's direct. It's what you do. But is it too generic? Not Grove-y enough?

---

## Combining Ideas

What if we combine the act with the nature element?

- **Mosscast** — casting voice to moss... too clunky
- **Fernspeak** — no
- **Rootvoice** — no

These don't work. Compound names feel forced.

---

## Current Top Candidates

After all this exploration:

1. **Moss** — the grove listens, soft but substantial, remembers
2. **Cast** — active, magical, throwing your voice out
3. **Thrum** — resonant, deep, alive
4. **Pour** — emotional, flowing, substantial (but not forest-y)

---

## Decision Point

I need to step back. What's the VIBE we want?

**Option A: The Grove Listens (Moss)**
- Passive, receptive
- Ancient, patient
- "Speak to the Moss"
- Gentle but substantial

**Option B: You Project Your Voice (Cast)**
- Active, intentional
- Magical, transformative
- "Cast your voice"
- Powerful but grounded

**Option C: Deep Resonance (Thrum)**
- Vibrational, alive
- Substantial, continuous
- "Thrum your thoughts"
- Unusual but memorable

Which fits Grove better?

Grove is about **warmth**, **home**, **your space**.

The grove doesn't demand. It receives. It welcomes.

That suggests **Moss** — the grove is listening, ready to receive.

But the USER is also active. They're choosing to speak. They're creating.

That suggests **Cast** — you're actively throwing your voice into the world.

---

## Let Me Walk One More Time

I'm in Flow mode. Blank page. I want to speak instead of type.

I press the button.

Am I "casting" my voice? Am I speaking "to the Moss"? Am I "thrumming"?

What feels natural?

"I'm going to **cast** this post." — Feels like magic, intentional
"I'm going to **moss** this post." — Weird as verb
"I'm going to **thrum** this post." — Awkward

But as a feature:
"Enable **Cast** to speak your posts." — Clear
"Enable **Moss** to speak your posts." — Sounds like a weird plugin
"Enable **Thrum** to speak your posts." — Unusual

Hmm. **Cast** works better as an action-oriented feature name.

But what about the NOUN form?

"I recorded that using **Cast**." — Sounds like podcast, Chromecast
"I recorded that using **Moss**." — Sounds natural, Grove-y
"I recorded that using **Thrum**." — Sounds unique

---

## Plot Twist: What About "Speak" But Grove-ified?

What's the Grove word for speaking?

In the forest:
- Birds **sing**
- Wolves **howl**
- Owls **hoot**
- Wind **whispers** through trees
- Streams **babble**
- Thunder **rumbles**

What do TREES do? Trees don't speak... but:
- Leaves **rustle**
- Branches **creak**
- Roots **reach**

What about **Rustle**?

Rustle is:
- The sound of leaves, of movement
- Substantial — you hear rustling, something is there
- Forest-native
- Active — things rustle, cause rustling

> "Rustle up a post."
> "Use Rustle to speak your thoughts."
> "Rustle: voice for the grove."

**Testing the tagline:**
> "Rustle is where your voice stirs the leaves."
> "Speak, and let the words rustle onto the page."

Hmm. "Rustle" is interesting but might have connotations of:
- Rustling cattle (stealing)
- Rustling up (finding/making quickly) — actually this works!
- Rustling leaves — natural

"Rustle up a post" — this actually works colloquially AND fits the nature theme.

---

## Updated Top Candidates

1. **Moss** — the grove listens, patient receiver
2. **Cast** — you project your voice, active and magical
3. **Rustle** — the sound of the forest responding to your voice
4. **Thrum** — deep resonance, substantial vibration

---

## Need User Input

At this point I have several viable candidates. Let me present them:

**Moss** — Passive, receiving. "The grove listens."
**Cast** — Active, projecting. "Throw your voice."
**Rustle** — Responsive, natural. "The forest stirs."
**Thrum** — Resonant, deep. "Vibration of voice."

Which direction resonates?
