# User Naming Journey

> What do we call the people who call the Grove home?

---

## The Problem

Right now we have:
- Users = Trees (established metaphor)
- But "trees" doesn't work as something you call people
- "Members" feels corporate, subscription-y, cold
- "Grovers" sounds like Sesame Street
- "Residents" lacks the nature connection

We need:
1. **Individual name** - What do you call ONE person?
2. **Collective name** - What do you call ALL of them together?
3. **Action/belonging language** - When someone subscribes, what happens? What ARE they now?

## Visualizing the Grove

```
                              ☀️
                    🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲
                 🌲    🌳    🌲    🌳    🌲
              🌲   [MEADOW opens here]   🌲
           🌲    where they gather    🌲
        🌲         and connect          🌲
     🌲                                    🌲
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
              ROOTS CONNECT BENEATH
                (mycelium network)

  Each tree is a person.
  Each blog is their canopy, their foliage.
  Their roots connect through Mycelium.
  They gather in the Meadow.
  They're sheltered by Shade.
```

## What IS a User in Grove?

Not a customer. Not a subscriber. Not a member.

They're someone who **planted themselves here**.
They chose to put down roots.
They're growing in community with others.

**What they ARE:**
- A tree among trees
- Someone who planted
- Someone who's growing
- Someone rooted here

**What they DO:**
- They grow (write, create)
- They reach (connect with others)
- They shelter (provide value to readers)
- They root (commit to this place)

---

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove. I see other trees—other writers, other voices.
I planted my tree here. Now I'm part of this place.
When I look around at everyone else who's here...

What do I call us?

Not a "userbase" or "community members."
We're all trees in the same grove.
We're all **rooted** here.
We're all **growing** together.

Maybe the name isn't about what we ARE (trees)
but about what we SHARE (roots, soil, this place).

---

## Candidate Directions

### Direction 1: The Rooted Ones
Focus on putting down roots, commitment to place.

- **Rooted** - "The Rooted" as collective, "I'm rooted at Grove"
- **Roots** - "Fellow roots" - but sounds weird
- **Planted** - "The Planted" - too past-tense?

### Direction 2: Growth & Living
Focus on being alive, growing.

- **Saplings** - New users are saplings, established ones are... what?
- **Growers** - "We're all growers here"
- **Growing** - "The Growing" (feels incomplete)

### Direction 3: Forest Community Words
Real terms for tree communities.

- **Stand** - A group of trees. "The Stand" for collective?
- **Grove** - Already used for the place itself
- **Canopy** - "Under the canopy" for everyone together?

### Direction 4: What Trees Do Together
How trees interact.

- **Interlaced** - Roots interlock, branches interweave
- **Kindred** - Trees of the same kind, related
- **Kin** - Simple, warm, familial

### Direction 5: Seasonal/Cyclical
Trees are defined by seasons.

- **Perennials** - We come back, we endure
- **Evergreens** - We stay, we persist
- **Deciduous** - No, this means we lose our leaves...

### Direction 6: The Forest Floor
What grows beneath and between.

- **Understory** - The smaller plants beneath the canopy
- **Groundcover** - Feels too small
- **Undergrowth** - Negative connotation

### Direction 7: Shelter & Home
Trees as homes, as places of safety.

- **Dwellers** - "Grove dwellers"
- **Denizens** - "Denizens of the grove" - too formal?
- **Keepers** - "Grovekeepers" - but that's more like admins

## Testing the Candidates

### "The Rooted"
> "Welcome, you're now rooted in the Grove."
> "Join 10,000 rooted writers."
> "A community of the rooted."

Feeling: Strong. Implies commitment, permanence, connection.
But: "Rooted" can mean "stuck" or "immobile."

### "Kindred"
> "Welcome, kindred."
> "10,000 kindred writers."
> "Find your kindred in the Grove."

Feeling: Warm, familial, suggests shared nature.
But: Doesn't have the tree/nature connection directly.

### "The Stand"
> "Welcome to the Stand."
> "Join the Stand."
> "You're part of the Stand now."

Feeling: Unified, strong, directly about trees.
But: Could sound militaristic. "Take a stand."

### "Evergreens"
> "Welcome, Evergreen."
> "10,000 Evergreens and growing."
> "You're an Evergreen now."

Feeling: Beautiful! Implies persistence, always present, enduring.
But: Already an existing tier name? Check this.

### "Kin"
> "Welcome, kin."
> "Grove kin."
> "You're kin now."

Feeling: Simple, warm, familial. Very natural.
But: Doesn't have tree connection explicitly.

### "Canopy"
> "Welcome to the Canopy."
> "You're under the Canopy now."
> "The Canopy grows."

Feeling: Collective, sheltering, overhead protection.
Individual: What's one person in a canopy? A leaf? A branch?

## New Direction: What About the ACT of Joining?

When you subscribe, you're not just becoming something.
You're DOING something. You're **taking root**.

The moment of joining = **Taking Root**
The state of being here = **Rooted**
The collective = **The Rooted**

Or...

When you join, you're **planted**.
The community = **The Planted**? No, too passive.

When you join, you **put down roots**.
You become **rooted**.
Together, you're **the grove** itself.

Wait. What if it's simpler?

---

## The Simplest Answer

**The grove IS its trees.**
**The users ARE the grove.**

- Individual: "You're a tree in the grove" (metaphor, not title)
- Collective: **The Grove** - "Welcome to the Grove" is welcome to the community
- Action: "You've taken root" / "You're rooted now"

But we need a WORD for the people, not just the metaphor...

---

## More Candidates from Tree Biology

- **Cambium** - The living layer that makes trees grow (too obscure)
- **Heartwood** - Already taken for auth
- **Sapwood** - The living outer layer (interesting...)
- **Bark** - Protective outer layer (too rough sounding)
- **Crown** - The top of the tree, the foliage (individual focused)

### What about SEEDS?

Before you're a tree, you're a seed.
A new user is a **seed** that's been planted.
They grow into their tree.
Seeds become saplings become trees.

But calling established users "trees" still doesn't work as a title.

---

## What if we DON'T need a noun?

Some communities don't have a special noun for members.

Instead, they have:
- A verb for joining
- A state of belonging
- Language that implies without naming

Examples:
- "I blog at Grove" (action)
- "I'm rooted here" (state)
- "I planted my space" (past action)
- "Fellow grovekeeper" (role, but too admin-y)

---

## The Keeper Direction

"Keeper" appears in the lore already. Autumn is "the grove keeper."

What if users are also keepers? Of their own small piece?

- **Keeper** - You keep your tree, your space
- **Groundskeeper** - Too much like a janitor
- **Treekeeper** - Awkward
- **Groveling** - NO (this means something else entirely 😅)

Wait... what about just owning the tree metaphor more directly?

---

## Leaning into "Trees"

What if it's not a title but an embrace?

"At Grove, every writer is a tree. You put down roots. You grow.
Your words are your leaves. Your readers find shelter in your shade.
Together, we're not members. We're a forest."

Collective = **The Forest**? But the place is "the Grove"...

Hmm. Let me try:

"You're not a member. You're a **tree among trees**."

---

## The Forest Floor Revisited

What if users aren't trees at all—they're what LIVES in the grove?

Trees are the blogs/spaces.
Users are the creatures/spirits that tend them.

- **Sprites** - Forest sprites, nature spirits
- **Keepers** - Those who keep/tend
- **Dwellers** - Those who dwell here
- **Denizens** - Those who belong to this place

"Welcome, fellow denizen."
"A community of 10,000 forest dwellers."
"You're a sprite of the grove now."

Does this work? It separates user from blog, which might be good?

---

## Actually... What About "Seedling"?

Small, new, full of potential. Everyone starts as a seedling.
As you grow, you become more established.
But you never stop being part of the seedling generation?

No, this breaks down. Established users aren't seedlings.

What about:

- New users = **Seedlings**
- Growing users = **Saplings** (early growth)
- Established = **Oaks** (but this is a tier name too?)

Let me check the tier structure...

---

## Tier Names (Need to Verify)

I think the tiers are tree types:
- Seedling (free?)
- Sapling (starter tier?)
- Oak (mid tier?)
- Evergreen (top tier?)

If tiers are tree types, then we can't use those as user names generally.
But we CAN use the state of being:

"You're a Sapling-tier member" vs "You're a sapling"

Maybe the tiers handle the noun and we just need good COLLECTIVE language.

---

## Current Best Candidates

### Individual (what you call ONE person):
1. **"A tree in the grove"** (metaphor, not title)
2. **"Keeper"** (one who tends their space)
3. **"Denizen"** (one who belongs here)

### Collective (what you call EVERYONE):
1. **"The Rooted"** - implies commitment, connection
2. **"The Grove"** - the people ARE the place
3. **"The Canopy"** - everyone together overhead
4. **"Kindred"** - familial, warm, related

### Action Language:
1. **"Take root"** - the act of joining
2. **"Plant yourself"** - the act of committing
3. **"Grow with us"** - ongoing belonging

---

## Testing Combinations

**Keeper + The Rooted + Take root:**
> "Welcome, Keeper. You've taken root in the Grove."
> "10,000 keepers, all rooted together."
> "You're rooted now. You're one of us."

**Denizen + The Grove + Plant yourself:**
> "Welcome, fellow denizen."
> "When you planted yourself here, you became part of the Grove."
> "We're all denizens, growing together."

**No individual noun + The Rooted + Take root:**
> "Welcome to the Grove. You've taken root."
> "The Rooted: 10,000 writers and growing."
> "Once rooted, always rooted."

---

## WAIT. New thought.

What if subscribers have a different name than free users?

- Free tier: **Visitors** (they're walking through)
- Paid tier: **Rooted** (they've committed, put down roots)

"Visitors are welcome. The Rooted stay."

This creates a natural progression:
1. You visit the Grove (browsing, reading)
2. You plant a seed (create free account)
3. You take root (subscribe, commit)

---

## The Journey Frame

| Stage | What You Are | What You Did |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Anonymous | Wanderer | Passing through |
| Free account | Visitor | Planted a seed |
| Paid subscriber | Rooted | Took root |
| Long-time active | Elder? Ancient? | Grew deep |

---

## Elder Trees?

For long-time, established, respected community members:
- **Elders** - Old trees that guide the forest
- **Ancients** - Very old, revered trees
- **Old Growth** - Preserved, valuable, protected

"The Elders of the Grove remember when..."

---

## I Think I'm Circling Something

**The answer might be "Rooted":**

- Simple, clear, nature-connected
- Implies commitment without being heavy
- Works as both state and identity
- Natural opposite: visitors (not rooted yet)
- Verb form: "take root"

**For collective:** "The Rooted"
**For action:** "You've taken root" / "Welcome among the Rooted"
**For longtime users:** "Deep-rooted" or "Elder"

Let me test this one more time:

> "Welcome to the Grove. Today, you take root."
> "Join 10,000 rooted writers."
> "The Rooted share soil. Our roots intertwine."
> "Once rooted, always rooted."

...That feels RIGHT.

---

## Alternative I Keep Coming Back To

**Kindred** is beautiful:
> "Welcome, kindred."
> "You're kindred now."
> "We're all kindred here."

It's warm, familial, suggests shared nature without being tree-specific.
Trees of the same species ARE kindred.
It works as both individual ("welcome, kindred") and collective ("the kindred").

---

## Final Candidates to Present

1. **Rooted / The Rooted**
   - Clear nature metaphor
   - Implies commitment, permanence
   - "Take root" as the action
   - Progression: Visitor → Rooted → Deep-rooted/Elder

2. **Kindred**
   - Warm, familial, inclusive
   - Works singular and plural
   - "You're kindred now"
   - Less tree-specific, more feeling-specific

3. **Keeper(s)**
   - You keep your space, tend your tree
   - Active, responsible, caring
   - "Fellow keeper"
   - Downside: might be confused with admin/staff role

4. **The Canopy** (collective only)
   - Beautiful image of everyone's leaves together
   - "Under the canopy" for belonging
   - But no clear singular form

5. **Grove-dweller** (or just the metaphor)
   - Embrace the tree metaphor fully
   - "You're a tree among trees"
   - Not a title, just language

## Questions for Autumn

1. Should free users have a different name than paid users?
2. Should there be progression language (visitor → rooted → elder)?
3. Is the word used casually ("hey fellow rooted!") or just in formal contexts?
4. Does it need to work on merchandise? ("I'm rooted" on a mug?)
5. How does it interact with tier names (Seedling, Oak, Evergreen)?
