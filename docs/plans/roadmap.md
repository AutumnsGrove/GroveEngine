# Grove Platform: Development Roadmap

> **Internal Technical Roadmap**
>
> This document tracks development through Grove's seasonal phases. Phase names are a sequence, not a calendar — nothing here is tied to a real-world date or deadline. Each phase has both a public-facing narrative and detailed technical implementation tasks.
>
> For the public roadmap, see: https://grove.place/roadmap

---

## Current Phase: Thaw

**Status:** Active Development

---

## Always Happening (Not a Phase)

Some work never "completes" — it's ongoing at every stage, revisited as the grove grows rather than checked off once.

- [ ] **Accessibility:** WCAG AA audits, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- [ ] **Performance:** Fast everywhere, always
- [ ] **Mobile Experience:** Beautiful on every screen
- [ ] **Edge Cases:** The small things that matter

## Phase 3: First Buds

_"Green emerging through snow"_

New growth appears. The grove finds its voice.

### Planned Features

- [ ] **Sapling Tier:** $12/month growth tier
  - 250 posts, 5 GB storage
  - 10 themes
  - Priority support

- [ ] **Foliage:** Theme library — more color for your corner
  - Minimal, Night Garden, Zine
  - Moodboard, Typewriter, Solarpunk
  - See `docs/specs/foliage-project-spec.md`

- [ ] **Fireside Mode:** Conversational drafting
  - Have a conversation, get your words organized into a draft
  - The fire doesn't tell the story — it just creates the space where stories emerge
  - Stands alone (decoupled from the cut Wisp editor tooling)
  - See `docs/specs/ai-writing-assistant-spec.md` for the conversational-drafting portion

- [ ] **Scribe:** Voice transcription
  - Lands alongside Fireside — both lean on AI underneath
  - See `docs/specs/scribe-voice-transcription-spec.md`

- [ ] **Curios — Phase 2:** Mood Ring, Badges, Shelves, Cursors, Hit Counter
  - See `docs/plans/features/active/curio-enhancement-roadmap.md`

### Technical Implementation

- [ ] Connect Foliage theme package to engine, run Foliage migrations
- [ ] Fireside chat endpoint + session state management
- [ ] Scribe transcription pipeline (currently an early attempt, not near complete)

---

## Phase 4: Full Bloom

_"Petals everywhere"_

The grove becomes a community. Roots intertwine.

### Planned Features

- [ ] **Forests:** Community groves — find your people
  - Essentially subreddits for Grove — shared spaces around topics/interests
  - Needs substantial infrastructure changes before this can be reliably promised
  - Pushed here rather than First Buds because the underlying platform work isn't ready

- [ ] **Amber:** Storage dashboard — see and manage your files
  - See usage across posts and media, visual breakdown by file type
  - Pushed further out; not an immediate priority

- [ ] **Rings:** Private analytics — your growth, reflected
  - Lands ahead of the AI feature cluster (Fireside/Scribe)
  - Privacy-first design, daily visitor counts, not identities
  - See `docs/specs/rings-spec.md`

- [ ] **Oak & Evergreen Tiers:** Full control
  - Custom domains (BYOD)
  - Theme customizer
  - Custom fonts (Evergreen)
  - Domain search & registration (Evergreen)
  - **Note:** tier structure itself is under re-evaluation now that the feature set has changed substantially — Oak and Evergreen may not survive in their current form. Track that discussion separately from this roadmap pass.

- [ ] **Foliage:** Theme customizer — make it truly yours
  - See `docs/specs/foliage-project-spec.md`

- [ ] **Community Themes:** Share what you create

- [ ] **Curios — Phase 3:** Webring, Status Badge, Activity Status, Now Playing, Blogroll
  - See `docs/plans/features/active/curio-enhancement-roadmap.md`

### Technical Implementation

- [ ] Build storage metrics aggregation (Amber)
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare for SaaS (custom domains)
- [ ] Implement Rings analytics with Durable Objects
- [ ] Forests: schema design, moderation model, discovery UX (early — infra work, not feature work, comes first)

---

## Phase 5: Golden Hour

_"Warm light through the canopy"_

The grove settles into itself. A time for refinement — the AI-assisted layer and remaining polish-adjacent features that aren't part of the "always happening" bucket.

### Planned Features

- [ ] **Import Tools:** Bring your words home
  - WordPress import
  - Medium import
  - Substack import
  - Ghost import
  - Generic RSS/Atom

- [ ] **Newsletter Integration:** Email your readers
  - Resend-powered delivery
  - Subscriber management
  - Opt-in/opt-out handling

- [ ] **Theme Marketplace:** Community creations
  - Submit and review process
  - Preview before installing
  - Revenue sharing for creators

- [ ] **Curios — Phase 4:** Ambient, Clip Art, Custom Uploads
  - See `docs/plans/features/active/curio-enhancement-roadmap.md`

### Technical Implementation

- [ ] Import tool parsers for each platform
- [ ] Newsletter subscription database
- [ ] Theme marketplace moderation queue

---

## Phase 6: Deep Roots

_"What the grove becomes once it's had time to grow"_

These features need the platform itself to mature first — more infrastructure, more trust, more time — before they can be built and promised responsibly. Not cut. Not soon. Real, and worth the wait.

### Planned Features

- [ ] **Wander:** Immersive discovery — walk through the forest
  - Much further out than the rest of the roadmap
  - See `docs/specs/wander-spec.md`

- [ ] **Meadow:** Social feed — connection without competition
  - Chronological feed, private reactions, no algorithms
  - A comeback, not a cut — just further out than previously planned
  - See `docs/specs/meadow-spec.md`

- [ ] **Chirp:** 1:1 direct messaging
  - Lands together with Meadow's return, as part of the same social push
  - See `docs/specs/chirp-spec.md`

- [ ] **Centennial:** The 100-year promise
  - 100-year domain preservation and read-only archival after 12 cumulative months on Sapling+
  - Grove isn't ready to make this promise yet — needs The Reserve, succession planning, and financial infrastructure to actually be keepable
  - See prior draft: `_junkdrawer/features/centennial/centennial-status.md`

- [ ] **Curios — Phase 5:** Shrines, Artifacts
  - The most ambitious curios — Shrines needs a spatial canvas editor, Artifacts needs 21 individual mini-components
  - See `docs/plans/features/active/curio-enhancement-roadmap.md`

## Phase 7: Midnight Bloom

_"The far horizon: a dream taking shape"_

Where digital roots meet physical ground. The vision that pulls everything forward — but this phase is **only** about the physical tea shop. No grove.place features live here anymore; Wander, Meadow, and Chirp moved to Deep Roots because they're still part of the platform, just further out. Midnight Bloom is the dream beyond the platform entirely.

### The Dream

> "A soft glow spilling onto quiet sidewalks after the world has gone still. The kind of third place that becomes a first home. A bloom that opens only in darkness, for those who need it most."

- [ ] **The Cafe:** A late-night tea shop
  - Physical space for the sleepless and searching
  - Queer-friendly, trans-friendly
  - QR codes linking blogs to tables
  - Community board for local events

- [ ] **Community Boards:** Physical meets digital
  - Print local Grove blogs as zines
  - QR codes linking to online versions
  - Monthly featured writers

- [ ] **Local Zines:** Grove blogs printed and shared

- [ ] **A Third Place:** That becomes a first home
  - Workshop events
  - Writing groups
  - Digital literacy classes

### What This Means Technically

- Integration between physical and digital presence
- Print-friendly blog export formats
- QR code generation for posts
- Event management system
- Community moderation at scale

## Cut

These were on the roadmap and are no longer happening. Listed here so the decision doesn't get re-litigated by accident — not out of embarrassment, just so we remember we already thought about it.

- **Wisp** (base grammar/tone/readability editor tool) — the underlying idea (conversational drafting) survives as **Fireside Mode**, which now stands alone rather than as a sub-phase of Wisp. The grammar-checking/editing-assistant layer itself is cut.
- **Ivy** (email at @grove.place, forwarding + custom addresses) — frivolous scope creep, cut entirely.
- **Trails** (personal roadmaps)
- **Terrarium** (creative canvas / visual scene composer)
- **Weave** (visual composition, animations and diagrams)
- **Outpost** (community Minecraft server)

---

## Infrastructure & Architecture

### Durable Objects Implementation

> See `docs/grove-durable-objects-architecture.md` for full specification.

**DO Phase 1: Auth (Heartwood)** - Highest Priority

- SessionDO for cross-subdomain auth
- Expected: Login 15s -> 2-3s, validation sub-millisecond

**DO Phase 2: Tenant Coordination**

- TenantDO for config caching
- Per-tenant rate limiting
- Analytics buffering

**DO Phase 3: Content Coordination**

- PostDO for real-time reactions
- Comment WebSocket for live updates
- Presence indicators

**DO Phase 4: Meadow Social**

- FeedDO for personalized feeds
- NotificationDO for aggregation
- Push notifications via WebSocket

**DO Phase 5: Analytics (Rings)**

- AnalyticsDO per tenant per day
- 87% reduction in D1 writes
- Real-time dashboard via WebSocket

### Hybrid Routing Strategy

| User Type        | Domain          | Routing             | Cost           |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Seedling/Sapling | `*.grove.place` | Worker wildcards    | Free           |
| Oak (BYOD)       | `custom.com`    | Cloudflare for SaaS | $0.10/hostname |
| Evergreen        | `custom.com`    | Cloudflare for SaaS | $0.10/hostname |

> **Note:** Oak/Evergreen tier structure is under re-evaluation — see the "Note" under Full Bloom's tier section above.

## Open Questions

- What will actual support time be for first 3 clients?
- Will non-technical users be able to use admin panel?
- How many clients can one person support before hiring help?
- Will social features drive retention or just add complexity?
- Does the Oak/Evergreen tier structure survive the changed feature set? (separate follow-up conversation, not resolved in this pass)
