Hi {{name}},

Quick thought on writing, in case it's useful.

---

The blogs I love reading aren't the polished ones. They're the ones where I can hear the person behind the words. The ones that sound like someone thinking out loud, not performing.

You don't need to have it all figured out. You don't need a niche, a content strategy, or a posting schedule. You just need to write like yourself.

Some things that might help:

- **Write like you're explaining something to a friend.** If you wouldn't say it out loud, you probably don't need to write it that way either.

- **It's okay to be unfinished.** Some of the best posts are "here's what I'm thinking about" rather than "here's my definitive take."

- **Short is fine.** A few paragraphs is a post. A single photo with a caption is a post. There's no minimum.

The internet has enough content. What it needs is more people writing honestly about what they actually care about.

That's all. Back to your regularly scheduled silence from me.

## Design Notes

- This is the most "voice-forward" email in the sequence
- No product features, no calls to action—just encouragement
- Combats the perfectionism that stops people from posting
- Reflects Grove's values: authenticity over performance
- Lighter touch, feels like a note from a friend
- "Back to your regularly scheduled silence" acknowledges that we're not going to spam them
