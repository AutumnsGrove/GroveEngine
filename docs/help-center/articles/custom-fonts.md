## Font recommendations

**For most blogs:** Lexend (the default) works well for general reading. It was designed specifically to improve reading fluency.

**For accessibility:** Atkinson Hyperlegible is excellent for readers with low vision. OpenDyslexic helps readers with dyslexia.

**For long-form writing:** Lora or Merriweather are designed for comfortable extended reading.

**For technical blogs:** IBM Plex Mono gives a clean, code-friendly aesthetic.

**For creative/artistic blogs:** Cormorant, Fraunces, or Caveat add personality.

## Uploading custom fonts (Evergreen)

Evergreen subscribers can upload their own fonts:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Typography**
2. Click **Upload Custom Font**
3. Select your font file (WOFF2 recommended for best performance)
4. Name your font and save

Once uploaded, your custom font appears in the font selector alongside Grove's built-in options.

**File formats supported:** WOFF2 (preferred), WOFF, TTF, OTF

**Legal note:** Make sure you have the right to use any font you upload. Many fonts require licenses for web use.

## How fonts are loaded

All fonts are hosted on Grove's CDN and loaded efficiently. Your readers don't need to download anything—fonts load automatically with your pages.

We use modern font loading techniques to avoid layout shifts. Text appears immediately in a fallback font, then smoothly transitions to your chosen font once it's loaded.
