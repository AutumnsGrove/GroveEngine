# What are Notes?

[[notes|Notes]] are short-form posts you write directly on [[meadow|Meadow]]. Quick thoughts, reactions, observations. Up to 500 characters, no title required, no external link. Just words, left in the meadow for others to find.

## Notes vs. Blooms

[[meadow|Meadow]] has two kinds of content that live together in one timeline:

|                | [[blooms                           | Blooms]]                      | [[notes                          | Notes]]                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **What**       | Blog posts from your [[your-garden | garden]]                      | Short thoughts written on Meadow |
| **Length**     | As long as you want                | Up to 500 characters          |
| **Title**      | Required                           | None                          |
| **Written in** | [[flow                             | Flow]] (the editor in [[arbor | Arbor]])                         | The compose box on Meadow |
| **Lives on**   | Your blog + Meadow                 | Meadow only                   |

Think of it this way: a [[blooms|bloom]] is a flower in your garden. A [[notes|note]] is a birdsong in the canopy. Both belong in the meadow. They just come from different places.

## Writing a Note

When you visit [[meadow|Meadow]] and you're logged in, you'll see a compose box at the top of the feed. Click it, type your thought, and hit send. That's it.

You can also add up to 5 tags to help others find your note.

## Who can write Notes?

Anyone with a [[your-grove|Grove]] account. You don't need to have a blog or a paid plan. If you're logged in, you can leave a note.

This is intentional. [[meadow|Meadow]] is a shared space. Some people want to write long essays. Some people want to say "the sunset today was ridiculous" and move on. Both are welcome.

## What Notes look like

Notes appear in the feed alongside [[blooms|Blooms]], but they look a little different. No title, no featured image, no external link. Just your words, your name, and the time you posted. The text is a bit larger since it IS the content, not an excerpt.

## Editing and deleting

Notes can't be edited. If you want to fix something, delete it and write a new one. This is a deliberate choice to keep things simple. Notes are quick thoughts. If it needs careful editing, it might want to be a [[blooms|bloom]] instead.

You can always delete your own notes.

## Notes and the feed

Notes show up in all the same feed views as [[blooms|Blooms]]: All, Popular, Hot, Top, Following. You can also filter the feed to show only Notes or only Blooms if you prefer one over the other.

Voting, bookmarking, and reacting work the same way on Notes as they do on Blooms.
