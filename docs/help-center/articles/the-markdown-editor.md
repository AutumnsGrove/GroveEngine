# The Markdown Editor

Grove's editor is where you'll spend most of your time. It's designed to get out of the way—write, format, publish.

## The basics

The editor uses Markdown, but you don't need to memorize syntax. Select any text and a floating toolbar appears with formatting options: bold, italic, headings, links, quotes, code, and lists.

If you prefer keyboard shortcuts:
- **⌘/Ctrl + B** — Bold
- **⌘/Ctrl + I** — Italic
- **⌘/Ctrl + S** — Save
- **Tab** — Indent

## Preview modes

**Side-by-side preview**: Click `[show preview]` in the toolbar to see your rendered Markdown alongside your writing. The preview scrolls in sync with your editor.

**Full preview**: Click `[full]` to see exactly how your post will look on your published blog—with your theme, fonts, and styling applied. Press Escape to close.

## The status bar

At the bottom of the editor, you'll find:
- Current line and column position
- Total lines, words, and estimated reading time
- Draft save status
- Ambient sounds control

## Autosave and drafts

Grove saves your work to your browser automatically as you type. If you close the tab or your browser crashes, you'll see a prompt to restore your draft when you return.

This local draft is separate from saving to the server—think of it as a safety net. Click **Save** (or ⌘/Ctrl + S) to publish your changes to Grove's servers.

## Adding images

Three ways to add images:

1. **Drag and drop** — Drag an image file directly onto the editor
2. **Paste** — Copy an image and paste it (⌘/Ctrl + V)
3. **Manual** — Type the Markdown syntax: `![alt text](image-url)`

When you drag or paste, Grove uploads the image automatically and inserts the Markdown for you. You'll see a brief upload indicator, then the image appears in your preview.

## Zen mode

For distraction-free writing, press **⌘/Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to enter Zen mode. The editor goes fullscreen, the toolbar fades until you hover, and it's just you and your words.

Press **Escape** to exit.

Zen mode automatically enables typewriter mode, which keeps your current line vertically centered as you write—no more typing at the bottom of the screen.

## Ambient sounds

Writing is easier with the right atmosphere. Click the sound button in the bottom-right corner of the status bar (it shows the current sound name, like `[forest]`).

Five ambient soundscapes are available:
- **Forest** — birds and wind through trees
- **Rain** — gentle rainfall
- **Fire** — crackling campfire
- **Night** — crickets and evening breeze
- **Cafe** — soft background murmurs

Adjust the volume with the slider. Your sound preference is remembered between sessions.

## Snippets

If you frequently type the same text—a signature, a standard disclaimer, a formatting template—save it as a snippet.

Snippets can have optional triggers. If you set a trigger like `sig`, typing `/sig` in the editor will insert your saved snippet.

## Campfire sessions

Campfire is a timed writing mode. Start a session, and Grove tracks how long you've been writing and how many words you've added. A warm ember glows in the corner as a gentle reminder to keep going.

Use it for writing sprints, daily practice, or when you need a little accountability.

## Line numbers

Line numbers appear on the left side of the editor. The current line is highlighted. They help you navigate longer posts and make it easier to reference specific sections when editing.
