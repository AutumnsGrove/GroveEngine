# Exporting Your Content

Everything you write on Grove belongs to you. Here's how to get a complete copy of your data.

## How to export

1. Go to **Account & Subscription** in your admin panel
2. Scroll to the **Your Data** section
3. Choose what to export:
   - **Full Export**: All posts, pages, images, and settings
   - **Posts Only**: Just your blog posts
   - **Media Only**: Just your uploaded images and files
4. Click **Export Data**
5. Wait while we package your files (larger exports take longer)
6. Download the ZIP file when ready

The page shows an estimate before you export: how many posts, pages, and media files will be included.

## What's in the export

Your download is a ZIP file organized like this:

```
grove-export-yourusername-2026-01-15.zip
├── posts/
│   ├── 2025-01-15-my-first-post.md
│   ├── 2025-02-20-another-post.md
│   └── ...
├── pages/
│   └── about.md
├── media/
│   └── (your uploaded images)
├── manifest.json
└── README.txt
```

**Posts** are in Markdown format with YAML frontmatter containing title, tags, and dates. The same format many other blogging platforms use. You can open them in any text editor or import them elsewhere.

**Pages** are also Markdown files, just like posts.

**Media** includes all images and files you've uploaded. Same filenames, same organization.

**Manifest** is a JSON file with metadata about everything in the export.

## Standard formats only

We use formats that work everywhere:

- **Markdown** for posts and pages: plain text, portable
- **Original formats** for media: JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.
- **JSON** for metadata

No proprietary formats, no lock-in. Your content works outside of Grove.

## Limits

**Size limit**: 5,000 items per category (posts, pages, or media). If you have more than that, contact support for a bulk export.

## When you might want to export

**Regular backups.** Even though we back up your data, having your own copy is smart. Export every few months if it gives you peace of mind.

**Moving to another platform.** If Grove stops being the right fit, your export has everything you need. Most blogging platforms can import Markdown files.

**Archiving.** If you're winding down a blog but want to keep the content, export gives you a permanent local copy.

## If you're leaving Grove

We believe your data should never be held hostage. When you cancel:

- Export remains available through your admin panel
- Your data stays available for 90 days after cancellation
- After 90 days, it's permanently deleted from our servers

No transfer fees. No artificial delays. No "pay to keep your data" schemes.

## What about my domain?

If you're on Evergreen with a domain included:

- The domain is registered in your name. You own it
- Request a transfer authorization code anytime
- We provide it within 48 hours
- No transfer fees from our side

Your domain goes where you go.
