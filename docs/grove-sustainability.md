# How Grove Lasts: A Sustainability Promise

> *Some trees outlive the people who planted them.*

When Grove promises your words can live for 100 years, that's not marketing. It's a commitment backed by financial structure, not just good intentions. Here's how it works.

## The Honest Reality

Grove is built by one person. Right now, if this doesn't work, I'm going to go work at Waffle House. That's not self-deprecation—it's honesty. I'm putting everything into this because I believe in what we're building.

But here's the thing: I also know I won't live 100 years.

So how can I promise your words will?

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: Getting Started (0–1,000 users)

In the early days, Grove is simple:

- Server costs come first (always)
- What's left goes to keeping the creator alive
- Margins hover near zero—maybe 5%

This phase is about survival. Building something real. Proving the model works.

### Phase 2: Finding Stability (1,000–5,000 users)

Once Grove has a real community:

- I start taking a salary (not "all the profits")
- Grove becomes its own entity—not just Autumn's side project
- Revenue beyond salary and costs goes into **The Reserve**

This is the transition from "person with a project" to "sustainable organization."

### Phase 3: Building Legacy (5,000+ users)

This is where the 100-year promise becomes real:

- Grove holds its own assets
- The Reserve grows
- The organization can outlive its founder

At scale, with $500,000 in reserve, Grove could run for 50+ years on interest alone—even with no new subscribers.

## Why This Actually Works

### The Math Is On Our Side

Grove runs on Cloudflare infrastructure. Here's what that means:

| Service | Cost at 1,000 users | Cost at 10,000 users |
|---------|--------------------:|---------------------:|
| Workers | ~$5/month | ~$5/month |
| D1 (Database) | ~$0.50/month | ~$5/month |
| R2 (Storage) | ~$2/month | ~$20/month |
| KV | ~$0/month | ~$0.50/month |
| **Total infrastructure** | **~$8/month** | **~$31/month** |

At 1,000 users paying an average of $11/month, that's $11,000/month in revenue against $8 in infrastructure costs.

The margins aren't 10%. They're over 99%.

This isn't normal. Most SaaS products spend 30-50% of revenue on infrastructure. Grove's architecture means almost every dollar can go toward sustainability, not servers.

### The Scaling Secret

Cloudflare's pricing is nearly flat at our scale. Whether we have 1,000 or 10,000 users, the infrastructure cost barely moves. This means:

- More users = more reserve, not more overhead
- Growth compounds into stability
- The 100-year promise gets *more* achievable over time, not less

## The Reserve

Once Grove reaches stability, excess revenue goes into The Reserve—a fund specifically for long-term sustainability.

### What The Reserve Does

1. **Covers emergencies**: If subscriptions drop suddenly, The Reserve keeps servers running
2. **Funds transitions**: If I can't run Grove anymore, The Reserve funds the handoff
3. **Guarantees Centennial**: The Reserve is what makes the 100-year promise real

### How The Reserve Grows

| Monthly Revenue | After Salary & Costs | Annual Reserve Growth |
|----------------:|---------------------:|----------------------:|
| $5,000 | ~$2,000 | ~$24,000 |
| $10,000 | ~$5,000 | ~$60,000 |
| $25,000 | ~$15,000 | ~$180,000 |

At $25,000/month revenue with ~2,000 users, The Reserve could hit $500,000 in under 3 years.

### What $500,000 Means

With $500,000 in reserve, earning 4% annually in a simple index fund:

- **Annual return**: $20,000
- **Annual infrastructure costs**: ~$500
- **Years of runway with zero revenue**: 50+ years

That's not a promise. That's math.

## Succession Planning

I won't live forever. Neither will Grove in its current form. But your words can.

### The Succession Plan

1. **Legal structure**: Grove will be incorporated with clear succession rules
2. **Documentation**: Everything about running Grove is documented
3. **Designated successors**: Trusted people who can take over
4. **Worst-case protocol**: If no successor, The Reserve funds a managed wind-down (years of static hosting, data export support, then graceful archive)

### What "Succession" Looks Like

- **Best case**: Someone I trust continues growing Grove
- **Good case**: A small team maintains Grove as-is
- **Okay case**: Grove freezes but stays online (Centennial sites remain accessible)
- **Worst case**: Years-long managed transition to static archives

Even the worst case honors the Centennial promise.

## Transparency

This document isn't locked away in an investor deck. It's public. You can read it. You can hold me to it.

I'll update this annually with:

- Current user count (ranges, not exact)
- Reserve status (growing/stable/drawing)
- Infrastructure costs (actual, not projected)
- Any changes to the sustainability plan

No surprises. No hidden pivots. Just honesty about how we're doing.

## Why This Matters

Most platforms make promises they can't keep. "We'll never sell your data." "We're not going anywhere." Then the VC funding dries up, the acqui-hire happens, and your content becomes someone else's problem.

Grove is different because:

1. **No VC funding** = No pressure to exit
2. **Extreme margins** = Sustainability is achievable
3. **The Reserve** = A structural guarantee, not just words
4. **Transparency** = You can see if we're on track

The 100-year promise isn't naive optimism. It's engineering. Financial engineering, legal engineering, organizational engineering—all designed so your words outlive me.

---

## The Covenant

When you earn Centennial status, you're not just getting a feature. You're entering into a covenant:

**Your words matter enough to me that I will build an organization capable of preserving them for a century.**

That's what your support means. That's what we're building together.
