# Grove Launch Email — Version 2 (Follow-up)

*Created: December 24, 2025*

---

## Context

The first email went out to 59 subscribers, but the link to grove.place wasn't clickable. This is a quick follow-up to fix that and give them an easy way to actually visit the site.

**The tone:** Warm, slightly self-aware, not overly apologetic. Autumn's authentic voice.

---

## Final Email Draft

**Subject:** Actually, here's a link you can click

---

Quick follow-up:

That email I just sent? The link wasn't clickable. Classic.

So here it is, properly linked this time:

**→ [grove.place](https://grove.place)**

Same invitation. Same forest screenshot. Same vision of a social platform that actually respects your privacy and lets you own your content.

Poke around. Check out the pricing. Tell someone if you like what you see.

— Autumn

## Voice Notes

- Keep it light and self-aware
- Don't over-apologize (that's not your voice)
- Make the link SUPER obvious and clickable
- Reference the original email so they know what this is about
- Short and sweet — respect their time

---

## Implementation

- **Send immediately after the first email** (within hours if possible)
- **Subject line is key** — "Actually, here's a link you can click" acknowledges the mistake with personality
- **Make the link unmissable** — bold, clearly formatted, obviously clickable

*This is about fixing a technical issue while staying authentic.*
