# Grove Launch Email: Version 7 (January Progress Update)

*Created: January 31, 2026*

---

## Context

Almost a month since the last email (v5 on January 12). Subscribers were told "mid-January" and it's now January 31. This email is honest about the delay, showcases the insane progress made, teases beta invites, and sets expectations for end of February.

**The tone:** Feelings-first. Less "what I built", more "how it feels to use now."

---

## Final Email Draft

**Subject:** It's been a minute. Here's what's happening.

---

It's been a minute.

I've been in the code all month. Not just adding things. Making it feel *right*.

Login feels reliable now. The kind of reliable where you don't think about it. You just get in.

Your words feel safer. Everything sensitive is encrypted in ways I can actually explain to you now (and I wrote documentation for it, if you're curious).

When something's wrong, you can tell me. Inline, on a dedicated page, or through Porch: direct conversations when you need real support. You won't feel like you're shouting into a void.

The admin tools feel real now. A proper Flow editor. A status page. Documentation that actually helps.

It feels closer.

**When can you come in?**

Small group first. If you want to be in that first wave, reply to this email.

After that: end of February for everyone else. I'm building in room this time.

If you want to help keep the lights on: [grove.place/support](https://grove.place/support). And I'm on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/groveplace.bsky.social) now.

\- Autumn

## Voice Notes

- Opens with acknowledgment of silence without over-apologizing
- Focuses on how things FEEL, not what was built
- "The kind of reliable where you don't think about it" is peak Grove voice
- "You won't feel like you're shouting into a void" addresses a real fear
- "It feels closer" is emotionally resonant without promising a date
- Beta invite via reply creates personal connection
- "Building in room this time" is honest about past over-promises
- Support and Bluesky asks are low-pressure, at the end
