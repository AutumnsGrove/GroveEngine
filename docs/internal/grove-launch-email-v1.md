# Grove Launch Email — Version 1

*Created: December 22, 2025*

---

## Context

This is the first email to the 60 people who signed up for Grove updates. They've been waiting. This is Autumn finally reaching out.

**The moment:** Grove is 90% complete, launching early January 2025. Two strangers at Barnes & Noble talked with Autumn for 2 hours about the project — genuine excitement, not polite interest. That energy is what this email captures.

**The goal:** Make subscribers feel like they're witnessing the next big thing. Give them a reason to explore the site. Encourage word-of-mouth.

## Final Email Draft

**Subject:** I'm finally ready to show you what I've been building

---

You signed up to hear about Grove. I've been quiet. That changes now.

Grove is a new social platform that goes against all the rules.

You own your content. Your privacy is respected. There's no advertising. No data harvesting. No training AI on your posts. Everything is privacy-centric, from the ground up.

Other platforms say that. We actually mean it.

I'm launching in early January. The site is live. You can explore it right now.

**→ grove.place**

Look around. Poke at things. Check out the pricing. And if you like what you see — tell someone. Word of mouth is the only marketing Grove has.

More soon.

— Autumn

## Subject Line Options

2. Grove is almost here
3. The next big thing (no, really)

## Visual Placement

- **Image:** Screenshot of the forest page (`/forest`) in autumn mode
- **Placement:** After "You can explore it right now."
- **Link:** Make the image clickable, pointing to `grove.place/forest`
- **Sizing:** Keep it reasonably sized for fast loading and mobile compatibility

The forest page has three seasonal modes (summer, autumn, winter) with procedural tree generation, falling leaves, snowfall, and winter birds. The "You built this??" reaction is real — use it.

## Voice Notes

Key phrases that landed:
- "A new social site that goes against all the rules"
- "We respect your privacy and you own your content. But, for real."
- "No advertising. No data collection. Everything is privacy-centric, from the ground up."

The "but for real" / "we actually mean it" framing acknowledges that other platforms make empty promises. Grove doesn't.
