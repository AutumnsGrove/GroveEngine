# TODOs for Grove Platform

> **Note:** UI components and Design System have been split into [GroveUI](https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/GroveUI). This repo focuses on the core engine, example site, and hosting (grove.place).

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS: v0.3.0 CI/CD Fix (2025-12-03)

### Status: Example Site Deploy Failing

**What's Done:**
- ✅ GroveUI v0.3.0 published to npm
- ✅ GroveEngine v0.3.0 published to npm
- ✅ Both repos tagged and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Updated all workflows to use pnpm (was npm)
- ✅ Fixed pnpm-lock.yaml to include @groveengine/ui
- ✅ Fixed `isomorphic-dompurify` → `dompurify` (jsdom can't bundle for Workers)
- ✅ Added `nodejs_compat` flag to wrangler.toml
- ✅ Added `--compatibility-flags=nodejs_compat` to deploy command

**Current Blocker:**
Deploy to Cloudflare Pages still failing with:
```
Could not resolve "crypto"
../output/server/chunks/mindmap-definition-VGOIOE7T.js:4:43
```

This is from **mermaid** library using Node's crypto module. The `--compatibility-flags=nodejs_compat` flag doesn't seem to be working.

**Next Steps to Try:**
1. Check if wrangler pages deploy supports `--compatibility-flags` (might be wrong syntax)
2. Try `--compatibility-flag nodejs_compat` (singular)
3. Set compatibility flag in Cloudflare Dashboard instead
4. Consider removing mermaid from SSR (client-side only)
5. Check `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare` docs for nodejs_compat config

**Relevant Files:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-example-site.yml` - Deploy workflow
- `packages/example-site/wrangler.toml` - Has `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]`
- `packages/engine/src/lib/utils/sanitize.js` - Changed to use `dompurify` instead of `isomorphic-dompurify`

**Commands to Resume:**
```bash
# Check latest workflow run
gh run list --limit 3

# View failed logs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Trigger workflow manually
gh workflow run deploy-example-site.yml
```
