# Grove Router Worker
# Proxies wildcard subdomain requests to groveengine Pages
#
# This worker catches all *.grove.place requests and forwards them
# to groveengine.pages.dev with the original host in X-Forwarded-Host.

# Route configuration - catch all wildcard subdomains
# More specific routes (auth.grove.place, etc.) should be configured
# in Cloudflare Dashboard HTTP Routes to take precedence

  { pattern = "*.grove.place/*", zone_name = "grove.place" }

# No bindings needed - this is a pure proxy worker
