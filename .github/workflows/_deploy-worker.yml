# Reusable workflow for deploying Cloudflare Workers.
#
# Each worker/service calls this with its own parameters.
# The calling workflow still appears as its own entry in the
# Actions tab with full step-level logs.
#
# Usage (thin shim):
#   jobs:
#     deploy:
#       uses: ./.github/workflows/_deploy-worker.yml
#       with:
#         worker-dir: services/heartwood
#       secrets: inherit
